I made a world for what I want to make as a survival raft game. I created a flat blue plane, which is solid on both sides (top/bottom). I also made a raft with
a flag generated by my script. I also generated another mesh for a cube barrel object in the water. I also created a player object, which rotates along with the 
raft as well as the barrel object.

I encountered problems with connecting the game objects for the player to a prefab. I had to teach myself again how to use prefabs and connect it properly to all my child
player objects. I also had a lot of problems with making the 3D script-generated mesh. It took me a while to figure out how to make it 3D, as well as how to map the UVs. 
Lastly I had some issues rotating the objects as they would not rotate! I realized this was because I was working in the start method, not the update method as I
should've been. 

In the video, there is some buffering issues when I was recording with obs, but this isn't from the simulation or script. I made sure to make the rotation constant to delta time.
